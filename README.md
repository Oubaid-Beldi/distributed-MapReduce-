Distributed MapReduce System
Overview
This project implements a distributed MapReduce system in Go, designed to count word frequencies across multiple input files. It follows the MapReduce paradigm, with a master coordinating map and reduce tasks executed by workers. The system includes fault tolerance for worker crashes (5% chance) and delays (10% chance, 0-5s). A web dashboard, accessible at http://localhost:8080, displays real-time task status, worker assignments, and job progress. The final output is written to mr-final.txt, listing the top 5 words by frequency.
This project was developed for the PDIST25 course by [Student1 Name] (ID: ETUDIANT1) and [Student2 Name] (ID: ETUDIANT2).

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Install Go (version 1.16 or later): golang.org
Ensure a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for the dashboard.

Clone the Project

Copy the project directory PDIST25-ETUDIANT1-ETUDIANT2/ to your machine.
Alternatively, initialize as a Git repository (optional):git clone <repository-url>
cd PDIST25-ETUDIANT1-ETUDIANT2



Verify Files

Ensure input1.txt and input2.txt exist in the root directory.
Confirm web/index.html and web/script.js are in the web/ directory.

Usage
The system consists of a master, multiple workers, and a web dashboard.
Clean Up Old Files
Remove previous intermediate and output files:
rm -f mr-* mr-out-* mr-final.txt

Run the Master
Start the master with input files (e.g., input1.txt, input2.txt):
go run main.go master input1.txt input2.txt

The master listens on :1234 (RPC) and :8080 (HTTP dashboard). It coordinates tasks and writes the top 5 words to mr-final.txt.
Run Workers
In separate terminals, start 2-3 workers:
go run main.go worker localhost:1234

Workers execute map and reduce tasks, with a 5% chance of crashing and 10% chance of delay (0-5s).
View the Dashboard
Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser. The dashboard displays:

Task Table: Task ID, type (map/reduce), status (idle/in-progress/done).
Worker Table: Worker ID, number of tasks assigned.
Progress Bar: Job completion percentage (0-100%).

Updates every second via the /data endpoint.
Check Output
After completion, view mr-final.txt:
cat mr-final.txt

Expected output for sample inputs:
hello: 3
test: 3
world: 3
a: 1
goodbye: 1

Stop the System
Press Ctrl+C in the master terminal to shut down (workers exit automatically).
